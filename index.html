   <p>
	   I'm Hime (she/her)! I was born in the backyard of the Li household. Jennifer and her sister, Angela, found me crying without my birth mom for 48 hours at 5-6 weeks
	   old. I was then nursed back to health and have been living as an indoor cat since then. My birthday is March 28, 2021 and I'm a domestic short-
	   haired tabby cat. I'm a California native and have been living in San Francisco Bay Area until Fall 2022. My owner moved to Ann Arbor, MI to
	   pursue her graduate degree (so she can buy me more food and toys). I weigh 10 lbs and enjoy nomming on dry kibble, prescription wet food (I get
	   tummy aches from eating too fast), and wet treats.
   </p>
   <p>
	   Though I'm a relatively chill girl, I'm still a bit feral. When I get excited, I like to bite fingers and feet (especially Jennifer's).
	   Otherwise, give me a comfy cat bed next to a big window and I'm all set! My favorite activity (besides napping and destroying things) is
	   chasing a red laser and zooming around the house. I enjoy the occasional petting, but only for a few minutes when you wake me up from my
	   nap. I'm independent so I would prefer not to have a sibling, but I can tolerate them if you give me enough time.
